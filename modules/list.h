/* This is a library module supporting generic lists.  A list has a current
position which is thought of as being between items, and can thus be anywhere
from before the first item to after the last item.  Lists are implemented using
doubly linked nodes, so that every operation is constant time.

The items stored in a list can be of any raw type (e.g int, char[20], struct...)
or pointer type (e.g. char *, struct...*).  The byte-size of the type is
specified when the list is created. In the case of a raw type, an item is copied
into the list and the caller does not need to allocate memory for it.  Items
must be passed to the library functions by pointer (because the library cannot
know how much memory is needed for the function arguments). So, it may be
convenient to define type-correct synonyms, e.g. for a list of int:

    inline list *newIntList() { return newList(sizeof(int)); }
    inline void insertIntBefore(list *l, int n) { insertBefore(l, &n); }

In the case of items which are pointers, the pointer is copied into the list,
but the caller is responsible for allocating the memory which the item points
to.  For uniformity, a pointer is passed using a pointer-to-a-pointer, so again
it may be convenient to define synonyms such as:

    inline list *newStringList() { return newList(sizeof(char *)); }
    inline void insertStringBefore(list *l, char *s) { insertBefore(l, &s); }

The lists provided by this module are not thread safe.
